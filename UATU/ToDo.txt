step 1
wire up events for:
searching -done

step 2
setup a state that will store the data, and bind that state to the UI
do this step for ProfileUI -done
do this step for ComicList - needs more research
step 3
hook all of it together, in the form of setting up the ftch call that stores 
the appropriate information in the appropriate state objects


States:

Search is the first state.
{object state}
The second state will be the profile image, and that is a result of the 
returned information from the fetch call fired from the search bar, of the Photo of the searched character
third state will be the character name
fourth state will be the biogrophy

WIRING OFF EVENTS:

The following items have state:
SearchUI
Profile
Comiclist

SearchUI
need to setup an event for the search string
on my input text, need a value = this.state.name search
on change event = this.state.handle this value change

fifth state will bet the returned 


***** NOTES *****

SearchUI now has a search button that works, 

have to fix the Profile setup. The Character name
and Bigoraphy information does not render to the middle of the element as planned

add in a feature to allow pressing Enter as a way to pass in the search input


******** CSS NOTES *********
Ive noticed that the Profile element shifts left and right based off of the displayed content. 
This needs to be fixed so that it is static in it's place. 

Would also like to stylize the name section

would like to stylize the Biography section
